# Our Beta CTI-CMM assessment tool

## Introduction
The CTI-CMM beta assessment tool is a stand-alone spreadsheet intended for users to download and use locally. Users self-evaluate their current maturity posture across each of the objective in a domain using the CTI0-CTI3 scale. In this tool, CTI0 represents no capability, CTI1 a partial implementation, CTI2 largely implemented, and CTI3 for fully implemented. 

The Beta CTI-CMM self-assessment tool is a standalone spreadsheet that dynamically populates as the user fills out scores across each domain. Inside of the spreadsheet, there's an introductory section, an obligatory read me on how to use the tool, and a master dashboard, before displaying each section's content. 

Please download a local copy of the spreadsheet.  

## How long will each assessment take?
The CTI-CMM assessment tool is comprised of 230 statements across its 11 sections. Each section aligns to a different function or stakeholder a CTI program could service, which means that not all sections are relevant for every CTI program. As a result, some programs, especially those with a larger set of customers, may spend more time than others. 

However, since the assessment is an introspective self-evaluation the CTI program should document its sources of evidence and line of reasoning to support the evaluation score it provides. As a result, CTI programs who plan to use CTI-CMM as a benchmark for program maturity and organizational reach will reap the benefits from having spent time enumerating supporting documentation--called "Evidence" in the assessment--and the line of reasoning for scoring.    

## How often should I perform an assessment?
We recommend CTI programs perform an assessment using this tool at least bi-annually, often after end of year strategic planning and at the mid-point in the year to benchmark progress. If a CTI program re-structures or expands its remit, we would encourage CTI programs to develop a roadmap using the criteria identified in each section then identify growth trajectory at the six month milestone.
